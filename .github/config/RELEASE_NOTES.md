## Recommended Tools

- Recommended flashing utility

[PixelFlasher by badabing2005](https://github.com/badabing2005/PixelFlasher)
- Pixel phone flashing GUI utility with features.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Unlocked bootloader.
- Backup your current boot image.
- Have root access using Magisk / KernelSU / Apatch (Any forks).

### Via Kernel Flasher
Download the correct AnyKernel3 ZIP for your device.
If you previously used another root method, clean it up first:
a. Magisk: perform a complete uninstall after flashing the AnyKernel3 ZIP.
b. KSU LKM (boot/init_boot/vendor_boot‑patched): Flash back the stock boot/init_boot/vendor_boot depending on what you patched.
c. KSU GKI: if you are 100% sure you already flashed stock init_boot/boot/vendor_boot, no action is needed; otherwise, follow the same steps as KSU LKM.
d. APatch: remove /data/adb contents to avoid leftover root conflicts after flashing the AnyKernel3 ZIP.
Flash the ZIP to the active slot using Kernel Flasher.
Install the KernelSU‑Next Manager APK, same version as mentioned in the release notes.
Open the KernelSU‑Next app.
Reboot the device if you performed any cleanup in step 2

## Force Load Kernel Modules (Bypass) — flashing with `Bypass-Image`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most users do not need this. This option does not help bypass root-detection systems — it only replaces the kernel image used during flashing for compatibility workarounds.

**How to enable:**
- Set `do.flash_bypass=1`, in the anykernel.sh file within the AnyKernel3.zip. 

**Behavior:**
- If `do.flash_bypass=1` is set it will move `Bypass-Image` to replace the usual `Image` file prior to performing version checks and flashing.
- If `do.flash_bypass=1` is set and `Bypass-Image` is not found, the installer will abort with an error to avoid accidental forced flashing of an unintended image.

**Why / When to use:**
- Use this only when a `Normal` flash fails to boot due to kernel module incompatibilities.
